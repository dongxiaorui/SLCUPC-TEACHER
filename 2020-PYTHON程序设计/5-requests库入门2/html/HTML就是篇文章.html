        <meta name="description" content="Modern mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have made many pervasive computing dreams come true. Still, many mobile applications do not perform well due to the shortage of resources for computation, data storage, network bandwidth, and battery capacity. While such applications can be re-designed with client–server models to benefit from cloud services, the users are no longer in full control of the application, which has become a serious concern for data security and privacy. In addition, the collaboration between a mobile device and a cloud server poses complex performance issues associated with the exchange of application state, synchronization of data, network condition, etc. In this work, a novel mobile cloud execution framework is proposed to execute mobile applications in a cloud-based virtualized execution environment controlled by mobile applications and users, with encryption and isolation to protect against eavesdropping from cloud providers. Under this framework, several efficient schemes have been developed to deal with technical issues for migrating applications and synchronizing data between execution environments. The communication issues are also addressed in the virtualization execution environment with probabilistic communication Quality-of-Service (QoS) technique to support timely application migration."/>

        <h1>Executing mobile applications on the cloud: Framework and issues</h1>
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Mobile and cloud computing technologies have enabled sophisticated pervasive applications. Yet, the applications on the latest generation of mobile devices today, e.g. smartphones and tablets, are still constrained by power consumption, speed of computation, size of memory, bandwidth of wireless network, etc. <a href='http://www.baidu.com' target="_blank">[1]</a>. Since the Internet became popular, a mobile device might overcome the constraints by offloading portions of application workload onto a server machine via the network to save execution time and conserve energy [2]. Recently, cloud computing has changed software infrastructures and business models of Internet services with technologies to provide and manage abundant resources of computation and data storage over the network at relatively low amortized operation costs [3].</p>
        <p>Today, the popularity of smart devices and mobile networks has substantially changed the way people access computers and network services. While the combination of cloud computing and mobile computing, termed mobile cloud computing has started to show its effects with many seemingly innovative smartphone applications and cloud services surfacing in the market today, we believe that the true potential of mobile cloud computing is yet to be explored. The following outlines the issues in today’s mobile cloud computing environment from the viewpoints of the users and application developers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Application re-design and deployment: Traditional client–server models have been successfully used for mobile applications to leverage the resources in the cloud, but additional efforts, such as application partitioning and deployment of services, are required to enable dynamic, fine-grain client–server collaboration, where the client may decide to offload a piece of work to the server during the runtime when the resources are available, if the offloading is beneficial. While partitioning an application to accelerate its execution by a remote server is a challenging task even for experienced programmers [4], many web applications or cloud applications actually perform slower than their local-execution version. Moreover, the client–server model is often overkill for deploying a personal application, as it requires someone to maintain the server and someone to pay for the service, which can incur significant cost and complexity.</li>
            <li>Network condition and service availability: The quality of the mobile networks is not adequate for delivering satisfactory user experiences via the collaboration between mobile devices and cloud services. It is difficult to guarantee the smoothness of a mobile application as the response time depends on the condition (i.e. latency and bandwidth) of the mobile network. For a pervasive application over a wireless network, performance and functional issues arise when the client and the server communicate over a slow or unreliable network connection. Many smartphone users share this experience and would have liked a mobile application to run locally when the network condition is poor. Unfortunately, application developers need to figure out how to achieve that by themselves, because the mechanism for making that decision is not included in any application development framework of today’s smartphones. The decision process can be quite complicated, as it has to monitor the network condition, acquire the application profile, and gather information from the device and the server [1].</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To address the above issues, we proposed a framework for a user to create a virtualized execution environment (virtual environment in short) in the cloud for running mobile applications. Unlike a client–server model, application redesign is not needed—the user can have an existing application running on a physical device or on a virtual environment. Our approach allows the user to control the deployment and execution of applications, and what the user needs is a trustworthy service provider to host the virtual environment, which is far more practical than verifying a growing number of service providers. In addition to offloading workload from a physical environment, the virtual environment presents opportunities to enhance the functionalities of the execution environment. For example, file sharing, automatic data backup and virus checking are additional functions that could be performed by the virtual environment in the background.</p>
        <h2>2. Background and related works</h2>
        <h3>2.1. The Android development framework</h3>
        <p>By July 2010, there were more than 100,000 applications developed for Android as claimed by AndroLib [9]. As an optimization for smartphone applications, the Android operating environment manages applications differently from traditional operating environments. An important aspect is that the Android system may kill a process when the system falls short of memory. To decide which processes to kill, Android places each process into an importance hierarchy with the running components and its states. The five levels in the hierarchy are listed in the following, with their importance from high to low: (1) A foreground process interacts with the user, and they would be killed only when the available memory on the system is too low. (2) A visible process does not have any components, but affects what the user sees. It is still important to keep it alive unless necessary to free resource for foreground one. (3) A service process is a running service that does not belong to the above two categories. They will be killed to favor two higher processes. (4) A background process holds an activity invisible to the user, which does not have any direct impact on the user experience. It would be killed to reclaim resource for the above three types of processes with an LRU list to ensure that the most recent activities would not be killed. (5) An empty process does not associate with active components, which are often killed to balance the system workload.</p>
